# Hi there 👋
🌱 I’m currently learning a Computer Engineering student at the @University of Florence.

## About me
 My goal is to become a **robot-oriented software developer**. The main focuses of my studies are: 
- *robotics systems and automation theory* 🤖⚙️
- *machine learning* 🧠♟️
- *software engineering for control systems* 💻⚙️
- *embedded systems and code coverage* 🚀✈️

 My main tools are **ROS**, **Python**, **C++** and **QT**.

## Repos I'm proud of
